[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Baggins800/snaplet-mysql-simple.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Baggins800/snaplet-mysql-simple)

This snaplet contains support for using the MariaDB and MySQL
database with a Snap Framework application via the mysql-simple
package. It also includes an untested authentication backend.
Heavily based on snaplet-postgresql-simple by Doug Beardsley.
